    " In machine learning, the dataset is typically divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set, known as the train-test-validation split. The training set is the portion of the data used to train a model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",

    "The importance of the train-test-validation split lies in the ability to accurately evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. By splitting the data, we can train a model on one subset of the data, tune it on another subset, and evaluate its performance on a completely separate subset. This ensures that the model generalizes well to new data and is not overfitting to the training data."

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns in the data that are outside the norm. Anomalies are often rare, and it can be difficult to know what to look for in advance, making unsupervised learning ideal for this task. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets to identify clusters of data points that are similar to each other, and then classify any new data point that does not belong to these clusters as an anomaly. Clustering algorithms such as k-means or DBSCAN are commonly used for anomaly detection."
